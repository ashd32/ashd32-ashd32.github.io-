                    <br>Dazed slow jams are the primary mode of Atlanta-based contemporary R&B/rap artist Ricardo Valentine, a singer-slash-MC who goes by the name 6LACK ("black"). 
                    <br>Prior to connecting with LVRN (Love Renaissance), the creative agency that has supported fellow Georgia native Raury, Valentine was signed to a label that 
                    <br>he felt restricted his creativity. After a few years of being held back, he made significant gains -- across 2015 and 2016 -- with contributions to the 
                    <br>Spillage Village compilation Bears Like This Too, as well as singles such as "Bless Me" and "Loyal." Once he was linked with Interscope, "Prblms" was officially 
                    <br>released in September 2016 as his first major-label-affiliated track. The following month, it entered Billboard's Twitter Emerging Artists chart at number five. 
                    <br>That single set up the release of FREE 6LACK, his debut album, which arrived the following month. The effort peaked in the Billboard Top 40 and climbed to number 
                    <br>five on the rap chart.  The following year, 6lack released a series of singles, including "That Far," "Grab the Wheel" with Timbaland, and "First Fuck" with 
                    <br>Jhene Aiko. In early 2018, he issued "Cutting Ties."
